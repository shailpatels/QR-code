# QR-code
helper scripts to test out QR code development

Things needed:
zbar:
     
     linux
     sudo apt-get install libzbar-dev
     
     mac
     brew install zbar (i don't have a mac so not sure if this works)

     Then
     pip install zbar
     pip install qrcode

Also uses python image library (i think that comes be default tho)
